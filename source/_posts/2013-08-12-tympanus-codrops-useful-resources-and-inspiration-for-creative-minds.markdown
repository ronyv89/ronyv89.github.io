As a HTML/CSS 3 novice, I was searching for resources that could navigate me in the right direction. That is when I stumbled upon [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/), by Tympanus. At Codrops you can find several articles and tutorials about the latest web trends, techniques and new possibilities. There are 5 categories of content in Codrops. I will you through each of these categories.

### Tutorials

This section provides you detailed tutorials of how to play with HTML, CSS and Javascript to create innovative products like transition effects, menus, 3D animation etc. Each tutorial is written by an expert and they take all the necessary steps to make sure that the audience understands each and every step.
